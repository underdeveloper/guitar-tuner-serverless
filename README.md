# guitar-tuner-serverless
Frequency-based guitar tuner using the user's microphone to detect tones.

Forked from [the original](https://github.com/OchiMoto21/guitar-tuner), which was made as a final project for a class.

Created by [yours truly](https://github.com/underdeveloper) and [my classmate](https://github.com/OchiMoto21). All credit for the actual alg goes to [Alex Ellis](https://alexanderell.is/posts/tuner/).
